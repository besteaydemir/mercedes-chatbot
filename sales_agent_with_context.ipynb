    "# SalesGPT - Context-Aware AI Sales Assistant With Knowledge Base and Ability Generate Stripe Payment Links\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a **Context-Aware** AI Sales agent with a Product Knowledge Base which can actually close sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was originally published at [filipmichalsky/SalesGPT](https://github.com/filip-michalsky/SalesGPT) by [@FilipMichalsky](https://twitter.com/FilipMichalsky).\n",
    "\n",
    "SalesGPT is context-aware, which means it can understand what section of a sales conversation it is in and act accordingly.\n",
    " \n",
    "As such, this agent can have a natural sales conversation with a prospect and behaves based on the conversation stage. Hence, this notebook demonstrates how we can use AI to automate sales development representatives activites, such as outbound sales calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the AI Sales agent has access to tools, which allow it to interact with other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we show how the AI Sales Agent can use a **Product Knowledge Base** to speak about a particular's company offerings,\n",
    "hence increasing relevance and reducing hallucinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we show how our AI Sales Agent can **generate sales** by integration with the AI Agent Highway called [Mindware](https://www.mindware.co/). In practice, this allows the agent to autonomously generate a payment link for your customers **to pay for your products via Stripe**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We leverage the [`langchain`](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library in this implementation, specifically [Custom Agent Configuration](https://langchain-langchain.vercel.app/docs/modules/agents/how_to/custom_agent_with_tool_retrieval) and are inspired by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) architecture ."
